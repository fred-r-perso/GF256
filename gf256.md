# GF256 module in C language

This module implements some arithmetics in the GF(2⁸).
The polynoms of GF(256) are represented as a byte (uint8_t), the maximum degree is 7.
The coefficients of the polynoms are the bits of each byte, they are in GF(2).

If a polynom has a higher degree, it is expressed as an uint32_t.

For polynom reduction, we use the AES irreducible polynomial (degree 8):
X⁸ + X⁴ + X³ + X + 1.
This gives the coefficients: b100011011 = 0x011B
